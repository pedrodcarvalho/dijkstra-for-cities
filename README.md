# Dijkstra Pathfinding Visualization

This project demonstrates the use of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a road network and visualize the path using an animated scatter plot. The project consists of two main scripts: `dijkstra.py` and `animation.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `networkx`
  - `numpy`
  - `osmnx`
  - `pandas`

You can install the required packages using the following command (or by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install osmnx networkx matplotlib pandas numpy
```

Additionally, `ffmpeg` is required to save the animation as a video. You can download and install `ffmpeg` from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Files

1. **dijkstra.py**: This script performs the following tasks:

   - Generates a road network graph for a specified place using `osmnx`.
   - Applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting node.
   - Saves the coordinates of the nodes visited during the execution of Dijkstra's algorithm to a CSV file.

2. **animation.py**: This script performs the following tasks:
   - Reads the coordinates from the CSV file generated by `dijkstra.py`.
   - Creates an animated scatter plot showing the path found by Dijkstra's algorithm.
   - Saves the animation as an MP4 video file.

## Usage

### Running the Dijkstra Pathfinding

To execute the Dijkstra pathfinding script, run:

```bash
python3 dijkstra.py "<query>"
```

Replace `<query>` with the name of the place you want to generate the road network for. For example:

```bash
python3 dijkstra.py "Manhattan, New York, USA"
```

This will create a `coordinates.csv` file containing the coordinates of the nodes visited by Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Creating the Animation

To create and save the animation, run:

```bash
python3 animation.py
```

This will read the `coordinates.csv` file and generate an `animation.mp4` file showing the animated path.

## Example

1. Generate the road network and run Dijkstra's algorithm for Manhattan, New York:

```bash
python3 dijkstra.py "Manhattan, New York, USA"
```

2. Create the animation:

```bash
python3 animation.py
```

The animation will be saved as `animation.mp4`.

## Notes

- The `coordinates.csv` file is overwritten each time `dijkstra.py` is executed.
- Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and configured correctly for saving the animation.
